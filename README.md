# french-connection-offline-website
this is the banned website with over 3200 hours of podcasts with learned people, govt and capitalists does not want the truth to come out , so i recreated its version  for offline purpose as it's only available on deep web
# how to use as an offline website on your pc or mobile phone
simply get the first index file and open it with a browser.
then use the website as usual but in mobile phones you need 
different file manager apart from already installed company file manager
to access all the materials otherwise it will show no media found.
